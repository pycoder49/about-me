## About me
I'm a first year **CS transfer** student here at UCSD! I finished the first two years of my college career at San Diego Miramar College. I also live pretty close by, so I commute to campus.


## An image of me on the beach!
![Picture of me on the beach](pic.jpg)

Here's my 

Here are some things that I *love*:
1. Origami -- I love making different things with paper, and have been doing it for some 11 years at this point
   * In case you're wandering, here's my [favorite channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MarianoZavalaOrigami) for this stuff!
2. Beach -- Whenever going out, this is the one place I love going to because there's an endless amount of things you can do there:
   * Volleyball
   * Picnics
   * A fun hangout with friends
   * Or just sitting and enjoying the sunsets
3. I also love just going out of the house and trying new things, especially new cafes!


## Codes and Quote
Here's a quote and a piece of code that I try to live by:
> Sometimes, the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us. - *Nicole Reed*

```
if <coffee.empty> {
    coffee.refill();
} 
else {
    coffee.drink();
}
```
